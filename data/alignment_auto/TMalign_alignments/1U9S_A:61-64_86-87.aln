Name of Chain_2: /media/mahfuz/DATA13/Research/MotifSimilarityAnalysis/RelativeGraph/RNAMotifFamilySimilarity/data/pdbx_extracted_ext0/5J7L_DA:238-244_252-257.cif
Length of Chain_1: 6 residues
Length of Chain_2: 13 residues

Aligned length= 4, RMSD=   0.75, Seq_ID=n_identical/n_aligned= 0.500
TM-score= 0.26696 (if normalized by length of Chain_1, i.e., LN=6, d0=0.50)
TM-score= 0.12321 (if normalized by length of Chain_2, i.e., LN=13, d0=0.50)
TM-score= 0.16861 (if normalized by average length of two structures, i.e., LN= 9.5, d0= 0.50)
(You should use TM-score normalized by length of the reference structure)
