   *************** updating history ********************************
   2012/01/24: A C/C++ code of TM-align was constructed by J Yang
   2016/05/21: Several updates of this program were made by J Wu, including
              (1) fixed several compiling bugs
              (2) made I/O of C/C++ version consistent with the Fortran version
              (3) added outputs including full-atom and ligand structures
              (4) added options of '-i', '-I' and '-m'
   2016/05/25: fixed a bug on PDB file reading
   2018/06/04: Several updates were made by C Zhang, including
              (1) Fixed bug in reading PDB files with negative residue index,
                  at the expense of the '-o' option now only being able to
                  output superposed structure instead of full rasmol script.
              (2) Implemented the fTM-align algorithm (by the '-fast' option)
                  as described in R Dong, S Pan, Z Peng, Y Zhang, J Yang
                  (2018) Nucleic acids research. gky430.
              (3) Included option to perform TM-align against a whole 
                  folder of PDB files. A full list of options not available
                  in the Fortran version can be explored by TMalign -h
   2018/07/27: Added the -byresi option for TM-score superposition without
               re-alignment as in TMscore and TMscore -c
   2018/08/07: Added the -dir option
   2018/08/14: Added the -split option
   2018/08/16: Added the -infmt1, -infmt2 options.
               TMalign can now read .gz and .bz2 compressed files.
   2018/10/20: C Zhang and S Gong updated the RNA alignment part of
               the program. Changes include:
              (1) new d0 calculation for RNA.
              (2) secondary structure assignment for RNA.
              (3) automatic detection of molecule type (protein vs RNA).
   2019/01/07: C Zhang added support for PDBx/mmCIF format.
   2019/02/09: Fixed asymmetric alignment bug.
   2019/03/17: Added the -cp option for circular permutation
   2019/03/27: Added the -mirror option for mirror structure alignment
   2019/04/25: The RNA-align algorithm was published by Bioinformatics

 How to install TM-align
=========================
To compile the program in your Linux computer, simply enter

 make

or

 g++ -static -O3 -ffast-math -lm -o TMalign TMalign.cpp

The '-static' flag should be removed on Mac OS, which does not support
building static executables.

=====================
 How to use TM-align
=====================
You can run the program without arguments to obtain a brief instruction

 ./TMalign structure1.pdb structure2.pdb

===================
 Fortran version
===================
You can download the fortran version of TM-align from
https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/TM-align/

This C++ version of TM-align implemented several features not available in the
fortran version, including RNA alignment and batch alignment of multiple 
structures. A full list of available options can be explored by:
  ./TMalign -h
